          <h3>MUCKROSS HOUSE</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              The focal point of the national park is Muckross House with its surrounding gardens and traditional farm. This 19th century Victorian mansion is designed and decorated in a traditional style giving you the opportunity to step back in time.
              The rooms are furnished in period style and allows you to admire the elegant lifestyle of the 19th-century upper classes in Killarney. Muckross Traditional Farm is preserved as a snapshot of a time before farming relied on electricity and all work was carried out using traditional methods.

          <h3>ROSS CASTLE</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Home to Chieftan O’Donoghue Mór, and built in the 15th century, Ross Castle was one of the last Gaelic strongholds in Ireland.
              Located on the shores of Lough Leane, it is a fine example of a 15th century stone tower house. Ownership of the castle was contested in the 17th & 18th century with both Gaelic Irish and Cromwellian forces fighting for it.
              In later times, the castle was owned by the Earls of Kenmare until 1956 when they kindly donated it to the people of Ireland. Since its restoration in 1990, the castle can be visited by the public, where they admire the period wooden furniture, traditional décor and the wonderful architecture.
              From here you can get a boat over to Innisfallen Island to see the 12th Century Monastic ruin and then continue on to the gap of Dunloe.
